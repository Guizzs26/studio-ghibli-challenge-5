## Learning 🧠

> This project aimed to create a login interface inspired by a design project in Figma. Through this project, I enhanced my skills in creating layouts using semantic HTML, styling with CSS and employing Grid layout effectively.
> I also improved the use of effects such as transition hover and scale to improve the styling of buttons.
> Another significant aspect of this project was implementing a responsive design suitable for tablet and mobile screens.
